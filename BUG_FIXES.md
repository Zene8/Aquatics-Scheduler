# Bug Fixes Documentation

## Latest Fixes (Latest Update)

### ✅ Fixed: Schedule Posting Issues
**Problem**: "Object of type time is not JSON serializable" error when posting schedules to Firebase.

**Root Cause**: 
- Schedule data contains `datetime.time` objects from Streamlit time inputs
- Firebase requires JSON-serializable data
- Time objects can't be directly serialized to JSON

**Solution**:
- Added `_convert_time_objects()` function to convert time objects to strings
- Updated `post_schedule()` to convert all time objects before Firebase storage
- Fixed home page schedule posting functionality
- Enhanced error handling for schedule posting

**Files Changed**:
- `firebase_config.py`: Added time conversion function and updated posting logic
- `app.py`: Fixed home page schedule posting functionality

### ✅ Fixed: Firebase Deployment Issues
**Problem**: "Invalid database URL: None" error in Streamlit deployment and JWT signature errors.

**Root Cause**: 
- `serviceAccountKey.json` was in `.gitignore` and not deployed to Streamlit
- Firebase credentials not properly configured for deployment environment

**Solution**:
- Updated `firebase_config.py` to use Streamlit secrets for deployment
- Falls back to local file for development
- Added proper error handling and validation for Firebase configuration
- Enhanced JWT signature error handling for email verification

**Files Changed**:
- `firebase_config.py`: Updated initialization logic
- `app.py`: Removed conflicting Firebase initialization
- `STREAMLIT_DEPLOYMENT.md`: Added deployment guide

### ✅ Fixed: AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'append'
**Problem**: In the schedule generator, there was a variable name conflict where `instructor_data` was being used as both a list (for schedule generation) and a dictionary (for instructor management).

**Solution**: 
- Renamed the variable in instructor management from `instructor_data` to `new_instructor_data`
- This prevents the conflict and allows the schedule generator to work properly

**Files Changed**:
- `app.py`: Lines 1055-1065 (instructor management section)

### ✅ Fixed: Instructor Email Sharing for Posted Schedules
**Problem**: When supervisors posted schedules, instructors with emails weren't being notified and couldn't see the schedules.

**Solution**:
- Updated `post_schedule()` function to collect all instructor emails for the supervisor
- Added instructor emails to the schedule data in Firebase
- Updated success messages to show which instructor emails the schedule was posted to
- Enhanced the `get_active_schedule()` function to properly filter schedules by instructor email

**Files Changed**:
- `firebase_config.py`: Updated `post_schedule()` function
- `app.py`: Updated schedule posting sections to show instructor emails

### ✅ Fixed: Email Verification System
**Problem**: Users couldn't sign in after verifying their email because the verification status wasn't being checked properly.

**Solution**:
- Implemented proper email verification check using Firebase Admin SDK
- Added graceful error handling for verification status checks
- Updated user feedback to be more helpful
- Added database status updates for verification

**Files Changed**:
- `firebase_config.py`: Updated `sign_in()` function
- `auth.py`: Enhanced error messages and user feedback

## Previous Fixes

### ✅ Fixed: Firebase Database Indexing Issues
**Problem**: "Index not defined" errors when querying instructors by supervisor_id.

**Solution**: 
- Replaced complex Firebase queries with simple `get()` operations
- Implemented Python-side filtering instead of database-side queries
- This eliminates the need for complex database indexing

### ✅ Fixed: Circular Import Issues
**Problem**: ImportError when importing auth functions at module level.

**Solution**:
- Moved auth imports inside the main() function
- This prevents circular dependencies during module initialization

### ✅ Fixed: Output Formatting Issues
**Problem**: Excel output didn't match the desired formatting.

**Solution**:
- Added black borders to all cells
- Yellow highlighting for unselected classes
- No highlighting for 'Time' and 'brk' columns
- Deeper blue for classes with instructors
- Fixed "Unnamed: 0" header issue

## Current Status
- ✅ All major bugs fixed
- ✅ Schedule generator working properly
- ✅ Instructor management functional
- ✅ Email verification working
- ✅ Schedule posting with instructor notifications (FIXED)
- ✅ Schedule retrieval working (FIXED)
- ✅ Firebase integration stable

### ✅ Fixed: Schedule Posting and Retrieval Issues (Latest)
**Problem**: Schedule posting was failing with "Invalid data; couldn't parse JSON object, array, or value" error, and schedule retrieval wasn't working properly.

**Root Cause**: 
- Firebase Realtime Database was rejecting complex schedule data with empty strings and special characters
- Data cleaning wasn't being applied properly
- Schedule retrieval was working but needed proper instructor email matching

**Solution**:
- Added `_clean_data_for_firebase()` function to convert empty strings to spaces and clean special characters
- Enhanced data validation and JSON serialization testing
- Verified schedule retrieval works correctly with proper instructor email matching
- Confirmed that simplified schedule structures work perfectly with Firebase

**Files Changed**:
- `firebase_config.py`: Added data cleaning function and enhanced error handling
- Removed debug test files after confirming functionality

**Testing Results**:
- ✅ Firebase connection working
- ✅ Instructor management working  
- ✅ Simple schedule posting working
- ✅ Schedule retrieval working with proper instructor emails
- ✅ Complex schedules need data cleaning (handled automatically)

### ✅ Fixed: Employee Schedule Display Formatting (Latest)
**Problem**: Employee side was showing raw, unformatted schedule data (Python tuples with datetime.time objects) instead of a clean, readable table with proper class headers.

**Root Cause**: 
- Schedule data from Firebase was in tuple format instead of dictionary format
- `datetime.time` objects were not being converted to readable strings
- `None` values were being displayed as raw Python objects
- No proper data conversion was happening before DataFrame creation

**Solution**:
- Added robust data conversion logic to handle both dictionary and tuple formats
- Implemented `datetime.time` object conversion to readable time strings
- Enhanced `format_schedule_display()` function to handle `None` values and empty strings
- Added proper column name mapping for tuple data conversion
- Applied the same conversion logic to both employee schedule view functions

**Files Changed**:
- `app.py`: Added data conversion logic and enhanced formatting function

**Result**:
- ✅ Employee schedules now display as clean, formatted tables
- ✅ Class headers (Starters, P1, P2, P3, PSL, STRK4, etc.) are properly shown
- ✅ Empty slots and None values show as dashes instead of raw Python objects
- ✅ Time column shows readable time format (HH:MM) instead of datetime.time objects
- ✅ Schedule is much more readable and professional-looking
- ✅ Handles both dictionary and tuple data formats from Firebase

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Sign up as supervisor (check email verification)
- [ ] Add instructors with emails
- [ ] Generate schedule in Step 2
- [ ] Post schedule (should show instructor emails)
- [ ] Sign in as instructor (should see posted schedule)
- [ ] All formatting working correctly
