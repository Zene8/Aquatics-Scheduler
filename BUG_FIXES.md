# Bug Fixes Documentation

## Latest Fixes (Latest Update)

### ✅ Fixed: AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'append'
**Problem**: In the schedule generator, there was a variable name conflict where `instructor_data` was being used as both a list (for schedule generation) and a dictionary (for instructor management).

**Solution**: 
- Renamed the variable in instructor management from `instructor_data` to `new_instructor_data`
- This prevents the conflict and allows the schedule generator to work properly

**Files Changed**:
- `app.py`: Lines 1055-1065 (instructor management section)

### ✅ Fixed: Instructor Email Sharing for Posted Schedules
**Problem**: When supervisors posted schedules, instructors with emails weren't being notified and couldn't see the schedules.

**Solution**:
- Updated `post_schedule()` function to collect all instructor emails for the supervisor
- Added instructor emails to the schedule data in Firebase
- Updated success messages to show which instructor emails the schedule was posted to
- Enhanced the `get_active_schedule()` function to properly filter schedules by instructor email

**Files Changed**:
- `firebase_config.py`: Updated `post_schedule()` function
- `app.py`: Updated schedule posting sections to show instructor emails

### ✅ Fixed: Email Verification System
**Problem**: Users couldn't sign in after verifying their email because the verification status wasn't being checked properly.

**Solution**:
- Implemented proper email verification check using Firebase Admin SDK
- Added graceful error handling for verification status checks
- Updated user feedback to be more helpful
- Added database status updates for verification

**Files Changed**:
- `firebase_config.py`: Updated `sign_in()` function
- `auth.py`: Enhanced error messages and user feedback

## Previous Fixes

### ✅ Fixed: Firebase Database Indexing Issues
**Problem**: "Index not defined" errors when querying instructors by supervisor_id.

**Solution**: 
- Replaced complex Firebase queries with simple `get()` operations
- Implemented Python-side filtering instead of database-side queries
- This eliminates the need for complex database indexing

### ✅ Fixed: Circular Import Issues
**Problem**: ImportError when importing auth functions at module level.

**Solution**:
- Moved auth imports inside the main() function
- This prevents circular dependencies during module initialization

### ✅ Fixed: Output Formatting Issues
**Problem**: Excel output didn't match the desired formatting.

**Solution**:
- Added black borders to all cells
- Yellow highlighting for unselected classes
- No highlighting for 'Time' and 'brk' columns
- Deeper blue for classes with instructors
- Fixed "Unnamed: 0" header issue
